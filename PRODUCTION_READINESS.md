## Clearinghouse Implementation ✅

### HyperCore-Style Features
- **Cross Margin Mode** (default) - Shared margin across all positions
- **Isolated Margin Mode** - Position-specific margin allocation
- **Portfolio Margin** - Advanced risk-based margining
- **Funding Mechanism** - 8-hour funding intervals
- **Multi-Source Oracle** - Weighted median from 8 exchanges:
  - Binance (weight: 3)
  - OKX (weight: 2)
  - Bybit (weight: 2)
  - Kraken, Kucoin, Gate, MEXC, Hyperliquid (weight: 1 each)
- **Validator Consensus** - Stake-weighted oracle prices
- **3-Second Updates** - Real-time price feeds

### Margin System
```go
// Account types supported
CrossMargin     // Share margin across positions
IsolatedMargin  // Separate margin per position
PortfolioMargin // Risk-based margining

// Per-asset parameters
MaintenanceMargin: 0.5% (BTC) to 5% (HYPE)
InitialMargin: 1% (BTC) to 10% (HYPE)
MaxLeverage: 100x (BTC) to 10x (HYPE)
```

## FPGA Acceleration Ready ✅

### Supported Hardware
| Card | Specs | Use Case | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
