- Contiguous memory allocation
- Minimal pointer chasing
- Fixed-point arithmetic for prices

### 2. Data Structures
- Lock-free atomic operations
- Pre-allocated memory pools
- Optimized heap implementation
- Binary search for price levels

### 3. Concurrency
- RWMutex for thread safety
- Atomic counters for statistics
- Channel-based communication
- Goroutine pooling

### 4. Algorithm Optimizations
- Price-time priority matching
- O(1) order insertion
- O(log n) price level lookup
- Batch processing for market data

## Implementation Details

### Pure Go Implementation
```go
// Achieved with standard Go optimization
type OrderBook struct {
    mu       sync.RWMutex
    bids     *OrderHeap  // Priority queue
    asks     *OrderHeap  // Priority queue
    orders   map[uint64]*Order
}
```
