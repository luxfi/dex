./lx-dex  # Successfully runs demo
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. Docker Hub Push
- **Status**: Expected failure (no credentials configured)
- **Impact**: None - binaries are available via GitHub releases
- **Fix**: Add Docker Hub secrets to repository settings if needed

### 2. Lint Warnings  
- **Issue**: Mixed named/unnamed parameters in pkg/crypto/kem
- **Impact**: Code style only, doesn't affect functionality
- **Fix**: Can be addressed in future cleanup

### 3. CUDA Container Tests
- **Status**: Skipped (no GPU in GitHub Actions)
- **Impact**: None - CPU tests pass successfully
