# CI Status Report

## ✅ Successfully Completed
1. **Pushed all changes to GitHub**
2. **Fixed CI workflow** - Updated to use new directory structure
3. **Added go.sum** - Required for dependency management in CI

## 🚧 Remaining CI Issues

The CI is failing due to some remaining compilation issues in `pkg/lx/orderbook.go`:

1. **Missing fields in Trade struct**:
   - `MatchType` field referenced but not defined
   - `TakerSide` field referenced but not defined

2. **Missing field in Order struct**:
   - `ExecutedSize` field referenced but not defined

3. **Type mismatch issues**:
   - Line 788-789: Using `*Order` where `uint64` expected
   
4. **MarketDataUpdate struct issues**:
   - Missing fields: `OrderID`, `Price`, `Size`, `Side`

## 📋 Next Steps to Fix CI

1. Add missing fields to Trade struct in types.go
2. Add ExecutedSize field to Order struct
3. Fix the type mismatches in orderbook.go
4. Add missing fields to MarketDataUpdate struct

## Current CI Results

- **Test Job**: ❌ Failed (compilation errors)
- **Benchmark Job**: ✅ Passed (with warnings)
- **Build Job**: ❌ Failed (same compilation errors)

The codebase has been successfully restructured and cleaned, but needs these final fixes for full CI compliance.
