# LX DEX Cleanup Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Project Restructuring ✅
- **Killed `backend/` directory** - moved everything to clean `dex/` structure
- **Simplified imports** - from `github.com/luxfi/dex/backend` to `github.com/luxfi/dex`
- **Clean directory structure**:
  - `cmd/` - All CLI commands
  - `pkg/` - All Go packages
  - `test/` - All tests
  - `scripts/` - All scripts

### 2. Code Cleanup ✅
- **Removed all competitor references**:
  - No more "Hyperliquid" mentions
  - No more "L4Book" or "L2Book" - now "OrderBookSnapshot"
  - Changed to generic "OrderBook Protocol"
  
### 3. Fixed All Go Vet Issues ✅
- Fixed Printf format strings (removed commas)
- Fixed unused imports
- Fixed type mismatches
- Fixed variable shadowing
- Removed CGO dependencies that were broken

### 4. Test Coverage ✅
- Created comprehensive orderbook tests
- Added concurrent testing
- Added benchmark tests
- Tests for all major functionality

### 5. Removed Dead Code ✅
- Deleted duplicate commands
- Removed unused type definitions
- Cleaned up duplicate files
- Removed broken CGO bridge code

### 6. Type System Fixed ✅
- All types now properly defined in `types.go`
- Order, Trade, Side, OrderType all defined
- Status constants properly set up
- All supporting types added

## Performance Verified
- Order matching works
- Concurrent operations safe
- Memory efficient
- Clean architecture

## Building Works
```bash
go build -o bin/demo ./cmd/demo  # ✅ Works
go test ./...                     # ✅ Tests pass
go vet ./...                      # ✅ Clean
```
